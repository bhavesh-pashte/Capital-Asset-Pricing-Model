# Capital-Asset-Pricing-Model
CAPM is a model that describes the relationship between the expected result and risk of securities.
CAPM indicates that the expected return on a security is equal to the risk free return plus a risk premium.

# ri = rf + Bi (rm – rf )

ri = Expected Return on a Security
rf = Risk free rate of return
Bi = Beta between the stock and the market
rm = Expected return of the market

# Beta:
It is a measure of a stock's risk (volatility of returns) reflected by measuring the fluctuation of its price changes relative to the overall market. 
•	ß = 0: No Market Sensitivity 
•	ß < 1: Low Market Sensitivity 
•	ß = 1: Same as Market (Neutral) 
•	ß > 1: High Market Sensitivity
•	ß < 0: Negative Market Sensitivity


# Risk Free Asset Return:
•	A risk free asset could be a US Government 10 year Treasury bill. 
•	Investors who are extremely risk averse would prefer to buy the risk free asset to protect their money and earn a low return. 
•	If investors are interested in gaining more return, they have to bear more risk compared to the risk free asset 

# Market Portfolio Return:
•	Market portfolio includes all securities in the market. A good representation of the market portfolio is the S&P 500. 
•	Market portfolio return is the average return of the overall return of the SP500.
